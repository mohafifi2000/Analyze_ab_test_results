# Analyze A/B Test Results
# Introduction
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. For this project, we worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. 
our goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should:
    -Implement the new webpage,
    -Keep the old webpage, or 
    -Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
In this project we apply some statistical analysis on the data provided by python, in this project we used liberaries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib and random.
The project consists of the following sections:

    Introduction
    Part I - Probability
    Part II - A/B Test
    Part III - Regression
    Final Check
    Submission
